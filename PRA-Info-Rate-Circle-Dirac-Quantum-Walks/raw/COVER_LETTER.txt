Dear Editors,

We submit the enclosed manuscript

    "Information Rate Circle in Dirac Quantum Walks:
     A Geometric Route to Relativistic Kinematics"

for consideration as a Regular Article in Physical Review A.

Our work identifies an exact finite-lattice geometric constraint in one-dimensional Dirac-type quantum cellular automata. For the single-particle unitary evolution U(p) = exp[-iΩ(p) n̂(p)·σ], the Bloch-axis decomposition relative to the propagation direction yields an identity valid at all momentum modes:

    v_ext²(p) + v_int²(p) = c²,

where v_ext is the group velocity, v_int is an internal rate derived from the Bloch geometry, and c is the Lieb-Robinson causal velocity. We term this the "information rate circle."

The key advance is establishing operational significance for v_int. We prove (Proposition 1) that v_int controls a rigorous upper bound on coin-position entanglement generation for narrow wave packets, with the one-step linear entropy bounded by ~σ_p² Δt² v_int². This connects the geometric constraint directly to a measurable quantum information resource. Furthermore, in the low-energy continuum limit, v_int/c recovers the relativistic ratio mc²/E, allowing us to reorganize familiar special-relativistic relations (time dilation, energy-momentum relation E² = p²c² + m²c⁴) as consequences of the rate circle together with the SU(2) structure.

Compared with previous work on quantum walks and quantum cellular automata (notably D'Ariano et al., Strauch, Chandrashekar), our contribution is threefold:

(1) An exact finite-lattice identity (not a continuum limit);
(2) An operational link to entanglement dynamics (Proposition 1);
(3) Concrete experimental protocols with parameter estimates for trapped-ion and superconducting platforms.

We provide two publication-quality figures visualizing the geometric decomposition and demonstrating the exactness of the circle relation across momentum modes.

We believe this work will interest Physical Review A readers in quantum information science, quantum simulation, quantum walks and cellular automata, and the emergence of relativistic physics from discrete quantum dynamics.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors approve this submission.

Thank you for your consideration.
