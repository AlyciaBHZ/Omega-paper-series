@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The term ``information rate'' is used metaphorically to suggest that the lattice velocity scale $c$ sets the total rate at which the system can evolve, split between external and internal degrees of freedom. It does not refer to Shannon information or channel capacity in the strict information-theoretic sense. The physical content lies in the connections to Lieb-Robinson velocity, entanglement generation (Proposition 1), and the ratio $v_{\protect \mathrm  {int}}/c \approx mc^2/E$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="This definition is meaningful for narrow wave packets localized around a central momentum $p_0$ in the long-wavelength regime $p_0 a, \mu \Delta t \ll 1$, where we can treat $v_{\protect \mathrm  {int}}(p_0)$ as approximately constant over the wave packet support. For broad wave packets or multi-mode superpositions, $\tau $ would be mode-dependent and the quasi-classical interpretation breaks down. See Proposition 1 for the narrow-wave-packet regime where this parametrization is self-consistent."}
