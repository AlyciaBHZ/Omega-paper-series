@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The term ``information rate'' is used in this operational sense, to indicate that the lattice velocity scale \(c\) sets the total rate at which the system can update, split between external and internal degrees of freedom. It is not intended as Shannon information or channel capacity in the strict coding-theoretic sense. The physical content lies in the connections to the Lieb-Robinson velocity, to entanglement generation (Proposition 1), and to the ratio \(v_{\protect \mathrm  {int}}/c\approx mc^2/E\)."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="This definition is meaningful for narrow wave packets localized around a central momentum \(p_0\) in the long-wavelength regime \(p_0 a, \mu \Delta t \ll 1\), where \(v_{\protect \mathrm  {int}}(p)\) can be treated as approximately constant over the wave-packet support. For broad or multimode superpositions, \(\tau \) becomes mode-dependent and the quasi-classical interpretation breaks down. Proposition 1 characterizes the narrow-wave-packet regime where this parametrization is self-consistent."}
